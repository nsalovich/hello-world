A misc, catch-all dish of a repository

Hi [insert demonym of github ... gittians? gits? gitters?] --

I'm Nikita, a PhD student studying cognitive science. I work every day to learn a little more about how people process information, and how it affects later judgments, memories, and understandings of the world. I have a particular interest in the consequences of being exposed to inaccurate information. I am likely drinking coffee and holding a cat.
